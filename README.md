# Graduation Project Source Code

Welcome to the source code repository for our Graduation Project, a computer vision-based application designed to enhance road safety through the detection of hazards like snow, ice, and water. This project, sponsored by Valeo, a global automotive supplier, addresses the critical challenge of reliable and efficient hazard detection using AI and machine learning.

Download and test the final application in EXE format. Upon downloading and extracting the contents, you can run the application "Hazard_Detector.exe" and perform testing using the provided video data.

## Testing Instructions

1. Download the final application in EXE format.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to access the executable application "Hazard_Detector.exe".
3. Open the application.
4. Upload the video that you wish to test the application with.

**Note:**
- Use a video captured from a dash camera under the front mirror in a car for valid testing data.

## Demo
